The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](01_data_warehouse_layer/docs/_Data%20Architecture.drawio.png)

1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.
